# Final Project DSAP — Can Economic Sentiment Predict Market Movements?

## Research Question

Can economic sentiment extracted from Google Trends help predict next week's S&P 500 return?
This project studies whether Google search interest for economic-related keywords can help predict next week's S&P 500 return.
We build sentiment indices from Google Trends weekly search intensity and evaluate simple predictive models using an out-of-sample split.

## Data 

- **Google Trends**  
  Weekly search interest data for 20 economically relevant keywords (10 positive, 10 negative), collected manually from the Google Trends website.

- **Financial Market Data**  
  - S&P 500 index prices  
  - VIX index  
  Data retrieved using the `yfinance` Python library.

All data are aligned at a **weekly frequency** and restricted to the **United States**.


## Methodology

1. Collect weekly Google Trends data for economic-related keywords.
2. Construct sentiment indices:
   - Simple index (positive − negative keywords)
   - Correlation-weighted index
   - PCA-based sentiment index
3. Define the target variable as next week's S&P 500 return.
4. Train models on 2015–2018 data and evaluate out-of-sample on 2019–2020.
5. Compare predictive performance using RMSE, MAE and R².

## Evaluation Metrics

This is a regression task. Model performance is evaluated using:

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R² (Out-of-sample)

Classification accuracy is not used, as the target variable is continuous.

## How to run the project

This project relies on a dedicated Conda environment to ensure full reproducibility across different machines and operating systems. Before running the code, please make sure that Conda (e.g., via Miniforge or Anaconda) is installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flavio-unil/Final-Project-DSAP.git
cd Final-Project-DSAP
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dsap-capstone
python main.py
