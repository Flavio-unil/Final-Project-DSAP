# Final Project DSAP — Can Economic Sentiment Predict Market Movements?

## Research Question

Can economic sentiment extracted from Google Trends help predict next week's S&P 500 return?
This project studies whether Google search interest for economic-related keywords can help predict next week's S&P 500 return.
We build sentiment indices from Google Trends weekly search intensity and evaluate simple predictive models using an out-of-sample split.

## Project structure

- `analysis/` : Jupyter with 4 notebooks used for data collection, cleaning data, feature engineering and exploratory analysis.
- `datasets/` : Raw and cleaned datasets.
- `main.py` : Single entry point that reproduces the full pipeline (load data → build sentiment features → train/test split → model comparison → save outputs)
- `outputs/` : Model results and figures generated by `main.py`.

## Data

The pipeline expects the following file to exist:

- `datasets/clean_data/merged_weekly.csv`

This dataset contains weekly Google Trends series (keywords) and market variables, and is used to build sentiment features.

## Methodology

1. Collect weekly Google Trends data for economic-related keywords.
2. Construct sentiment indices:
   - Simple index (positive − negative keywords)
   - Correlation-weighted index
   - PCA-based sentiment index
3. Define the target variable as next week's S&P 500 return.
4. Train models on 2015–2018 data and evaluate out-of-sample on 2019–2020.
5. Compare predictive performance using RMSE, MAE and R².

## Evaluation Metrics

This is a regression task. Model performance is evaluated using:

- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- R² (Out-of-sample)

Classification accuracy is not used, as the target variable is continuous.


## How to run the project

From the project root directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Flavio-unil/Final-Project-DSAP.git
cd Final-Project-DSAP
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dsap-capstone
python main.py
