# Final Project DSAP — Can Economic Sentiment Predict Market Movements?

This project studies whether Google search interest for economic-related keywords can help predict next week's S&P 500 return.

We build sentiment indices from Google Trends weekly search intensity and evaluate simple predictive models using an out-of-sample split.

## Project structure

- `analysis/` : Jupyter with 4 notebooks used for data collection, cleaning data, feature engineering and exploratory analysis.
- `datasets/` : Raw and cleaned datasets.
- `main.py` : Single entry point that reproduces the full pipeline (load data → build sentiment features → train/test split → model comparison → save outputs)
- `outputs/` : Model results and figures generated by `main.py`.

## Data

The pipeline expects the following file to exist:

- `datasets/clean_data/merged_weekly.csv`

This dataset contains weekly Google Trends series (keywords) and market variables, and is used to build sentiment features.


## How to run the project on Nuvolos

This project was developed and tested on **Nuvolos**, which already provides
a working Python environment.

### 1. Install dependencies
From the project root directory:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

### Optional: Conda environment

An optional `environment.yml` file is provided for full reproducibility.
It can be used to recreate the environment with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate <env_name>
python main.py
